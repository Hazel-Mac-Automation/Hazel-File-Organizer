Hazel is a sophisticated automation tool that helps you manage files effortlessly on your Mac. It works in the background, automatically organizing your files based on rules you create. You can set conditions such as file type, name, date added, or even content, and define actions like moving, renaming, copying, or deleting files.

This utility is perfect for users who want to keep their digital workspace clean and efficient without spending time on manual file management. Hazel supports a wide range of file types and integrates with macOS features like Tags, Finder, and Apple Script. It is optimized for performance on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, ensuring smooth operation even with large numbers of files.

From organizing your Downloads folder to archiving old projects, Hazel handles it all silently and reliably. It’s like having a personal assistant for your Mac—always working, always organizing.
